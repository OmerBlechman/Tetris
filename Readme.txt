Description:

The goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling shapes inside the Matrix (playing field).
Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.
As lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging.
If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.
